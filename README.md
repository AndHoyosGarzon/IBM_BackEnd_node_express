# Api Rest Books Andres H

-This **ApiRest** was created using **node.js with express.js**.

-The recommendation was to work with postman but in my case I worked with a **VS_code extension called Thunder Client**, which is very similar to using postman but in my opinion is more basic in its use.

-Each of the requests made from the login route has to carry data in the body of the request, transmitted by Thunder client.

-In the axios directory you will find everything that is dependent on the requests in the front-end to request the data according to the requirement.

-Please do an **npm install** when testing the api so that it installs all the required dependencies.

-If you have any questions or suggestions, I would appreciate it if you let me know.
